# HTML/CSS Workshop Official Repository
### What's in this repo?
In here you will find a list of all the materials we will be working with during the course of the workshop.

You will be working from the `myPersonalSite` file, where you will find a basic `index.html` file as well as a `styles` folder.

There is also an `example folder` which contains an example site with a similar file structure. 

We've also included a `resources` file for you to reference after this workshop is complete.
